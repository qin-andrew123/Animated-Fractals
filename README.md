# Animated-Graphs

Based on Tutorials from catlikecoding.com. This ReadMe serves as a documentation of what I've learned from the tutorials I followed from catlikecoding.com

## Part 1: Graphs
- Learned about URP and Shaders. 
- Shaders use their own language different from C#
- There are different types of functions that can be used, will have to look into documentation on my own
- URP is its own set of shaders different from the built in Unity ones. 
- Similar but uses graphical coding instead
- Learned about animating graphs.

## Part 2: 3D Graphs
- Learned how to implement graphs in 3D space
- Learned about Delegates and how to use them 
- Refreshed on Enums
- Expanded by testing out different functions to play with

## Part 3: Determining Performance
- Learned how to analyze performance of specific scenes and frames within Unity
- Learned basic optimizations for renderers
- Also implemented some minor UI elements to determine FPS and MS
- Implemented basic automated function switching and learned Lerp and SmoothStep
