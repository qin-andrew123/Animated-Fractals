# Animated-Fractals

Working up from graphs to building 3D shapes to fractals in Unity

## Part 1: Graphs

Learned about URP and Shaders. 
- Shaders use their own language different from C#
- There are different types of functions that can be used, will have to look into documentation on my own

- URP is its own set of shaders different from the built in Unity ones. 
- Similar but uses graphical coding instead

Learned about animating graphs.
- In update, want to take a function, and move it across a range
